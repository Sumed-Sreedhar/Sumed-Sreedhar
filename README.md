# Hi, I’m Sumed

Instrumentation Engineering student focused on **embedded systems**.

I’m currently building STM32-based projects to strengthen fundamentals in:
- Embedded C
- GPIO, EXTI, and timer interrupts
- Polling vs event-driven design
- State-based system architecture

My work emphasizes **hardware-validated designs**, clean interrupt handling, and understanding how embedded systems behave under real constraints.

## Projects
- **GPIO-Driven Status Controller**  
  Foundational project exploring GPIO, polling, debouncing, and interrupts.

- **Event-Driven LED Controller**  
  Event-driven design using EXTI for input and timers for output control, with strict separation between state and action.

More projects will be added as I continue building.

## Tools & Platforms
- STM32 (STM32F446RE)
- Embedded C
- STM32 HAL
- Linux
- Git & GitHub
